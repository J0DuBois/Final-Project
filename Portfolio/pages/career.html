        <p>When I started to learn programming it was python that I used first.
          It was in 11th grade When I was introduced to it. As soon as I started and learned the simple functions I loved it.
          This love fueled my imagination, which caused me to create several projects.
           After I had completed thoes I then when on to learn other languages in order to create them there as well</p>

          </a>
          <h2>C++</h2>
        </div>
        <p>As I stated, I went to learn other languages in order to recreate the projects I had in python.
          That didn’t start until the following school year. It wasn't hard or difficult,
          but I felt like I wasn’t learning anything. This was because I was just copying what was in python to c++ but adapting its syntax.
          I didn't realize it until my first semester of college where the class was touching upon stuff, I already knew but, I was learning the language.
          And since then, I have loved working with both languages.

        <p>In my first semester of college, I tried to teach myself HTML and CSS in order to make my own website.
          At first it was a disaster I had no idea where to start and W3shcools wasn’t helping much so I resorted to searching YouTube videos on how to do certain things That didn’t go well and made me even more confused.
          This was probably because I had no idea what I wanted to do.
          Thankfully in my second semester of college we went over the process of
          designing and then building a website which helped clear my issues and allowed me to build this website.
